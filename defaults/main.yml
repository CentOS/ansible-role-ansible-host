# Default variables for ansible-host role
# As the ansible mgmt host can also use various inventories, etc
# We'll define multiple paths where to checkout and which keys to use
#

# important : see ansible_py_version vars/* files for distro/release
# This will be used to know which python-pip pkg to use
# and also pip dependencies for correct interpreter
# see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/devel/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#node-requirement-summary for matching table
# example: ansible-core-2.13, rpm pkg, requires 3.9 (so not matching upstream, be prepared)
